# Python_Flash_card

Python flash cards is a small application to learn French. It shows a card with a French word then reveal the translation in English after three seconds. If the user clicks on the ✔ button, the word will be removed from the list of words(csv), but if the user clicks on the ❌ button, the word will be added to a new csv file "words-to-learn" that will be loaded next time the program is run.
